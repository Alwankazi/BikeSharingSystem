            <h2> Hybrid Bike </h2>
            <p> A bicycle ideal for fitness, and long distance touring is a hybrid bicycle. Hybrid bicycles are basically a combination of a road bike (700c road bicycle wheels) and a mountain bike (flat handlebars). These bikes are more towards performance and offer an efficient riding position. There are a wide variety of hybrid bicycles available in the market. Some have wider tires and a suspension fork up front, to take the sting out of rough roads, while others have narrower tires and a rigid fork for more efficient tarmac riding. </p>
            <br>
            <h2>Road Bike </h2>
            <p> Designed for performance and speed, road bikes are light and meant to be ridden on paved roads. The geometry of these bikes offers a short wheelbase, low bottom bracket, and the steep headtube that lets the rider to react instantly. The bike also offers a low centre of gravity which is suitable for turning. Other characteristics of these bicycles are the thin tyres 20-25mm width placed on 700C wheels. The bike also comes with a drop bar handlebar that positions the rider in an aero position. </p>
            <br>
            <h2> Mountain Bike </h2>
            <p> If you are looking for a bicycle that can be ridden with ease on city and off-road, mountain bike is what you should be looking at. As the bicycle comes with wide tyres that offer extra traction and an upright frame offering higher clearance, it is easy to ride on a variety of surfaces, including gravel, dirt, rock and sand. Besides, these type of cycles also has a wide range of gearing that offers a variety of gears to choose while riding on flat or steep terrains. MTB’s are usually available in 2 types; the hardtail (front suspension) and a dual suspension bicycle (front and rear suspension). </p>
            <br>
            <h2> Fat Bike </h2>
            <p> These type of cycles comes with fat tyres which are oversized. Such types of bicycles are meant to be ridden on snow, sand, dirt tracks and on rocky terrains.

            <br>
            <h2> Time Trial Bike </h2>
            <p> These bikes are a modulated version of road bikes with more emphasis on an aerodynamic frame design and also an addition of time trail specific handlebar extension to make the riding posture aero </p>
            <br>
            <h2> BMX Biker </h2>
            <p> If you are looking to perform stunts on a bicycle, a BMX bicycle is what you should be looking at. These types of cycles come with small frame and wheels. They also have a flat handlebar and no gears. In spite of their small size, the bikes are strong and can handle the weight of an average adult while performing the stunts. The best part about BMX bikes is the 360° rotational axis and extension tubes from the front and back tire hub flanges which are all used to perform tricks. </p>
            <br>
